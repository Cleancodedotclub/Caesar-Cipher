JavaScript Caesar's Cipher is a repository that provides a simple and customizable encryption and decryption tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the encryption and decryption tool. The HTML files include the basic structure for the tool and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the tool buttons and display. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher, as well as updating the tool display.

Users can customize the encryption and decryption tool by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
